Blender\u2019s features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, camera tracking, rendering, video editing and compositing. Alongside the modeling features it also has an integrated game engine. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia . We use Blender because it is a powerful open source, free of charge 3D application. It has a broad user base and a excellent reference. If you are already familiar with Blender, or know other 3D applications like Maya, C4D, Rhino, 3ds Max, or or or, you can skip this part and move on to the Slicer section or export your plans directly from within Blender using the Paper Model Add-on . Hint You should use a 3 button mouse if you are using a laptop. It makes the handling of Blender way easier. (UI) Shortcuts \u00b6 Blender relies heavily on shortcuts. See an overview of all shortcuts here waldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper/#Blender . Some shortcuts depend on the position of the mouse e.g. x for deleting only works when the mouse is over the 3D view. (UI) Search Menu \u00b6 Another quick way to call actions or open panels is the \u201cSearch Menu\u201d. It gives you quick access to all of Blenders commands by typing. you can open it just by hitting the space bar . This is pretty handy if you know a commands name but don\u2019t know where to find it. Read more here. (UI) Customize \u00b6 Note The interface is highly customizable in Blender. We will only adjust some minor settings to make it more user friendly. Go to: File > User Preferences\u2026 and select the \u201cInput\u201d tab. Change the Mouse selection from right click to left click in the settings > input tab \u201cEmulate Numpad\u201d (if you\u2019re on a laptop you can use the numbers instead of the numpad) Adjust UI colors in the theme tab (if you like it more fancy) Hint You need to hit \u201cSave User Settings\u201d at the bottom of the window to apply these changes. You can add or remove windows by right clicking into the \u201cseam\u201d between two windows. This allows you to add new windows or join existing ones. When adding you can toggle a horizontal or vertical split by pressing the middle mouse button This will be indicated by the dashed line that appears on the window you are trying to split. You can do the same by clicking and dragging the striped corner of a window to the left or down. To remove those windows just join them again. (See the animation below.) Mouse Action Right click window seam split/join windows Right click window seam select split + middle mouse toggle horizontal/vertical split click + drag striped corner down/up split horizontally click + drag striped corner left/right split vertically You can change the content of a window by using the dropdown menu under the icon in the header (which is at the bottom of the 3D view). (UI) View Region \u00b6 Within the 3D view you also have a tool bar on the left and the tool shelf on the right. t shows tool bar and n the tool shelf. On the toolbar you have the most common commands for transformation, editing, creation and many more organized as tabs. On the tool shelf you can access commonly used properties for transformations, the view, the 3D cursor and others organized as expandable panels. Both of these regions are kind of quick access palettes for properties and action that are essential for editing. (UI) Viewport Shading \u00b6 There are several shading methods available. You can see your model as: Bounding Box Wireframe Solid Texture Material Rendered You can switch the shading method on the bottom of the 3D view. For us the only important options are \u201cSolid\u201d, \u201cWireframe\u201d and \u201cBounding Box\u201d. Read more about this in the docs. (UI) View Navigation \u00b6 The basic navigation in the 3D view is done with the mouse. You can also change the view by using the numpad. Mouse Action left mouse select right mouse set 3D cursor position middle mouse click orbit middle mouse click + \u21e7 pan scroll zoom Note The most useful keys on the numpad are (table also has emulated numpad) Key Combo (emulated) View Change Key Combo 1 Front Numpad 1 ^ + 1 Back Numpad ^ + 1 3 Right Numpad 3 ^ + 3 Left Numpad ^ + 3 7 Top Numpad 7 ^ + 7 Bottom Numpad ^ + 7 5 Toggle orthographic vs perspective mode Numpad 5 0 Camera View Numpad 0 Not so important keys Numpad 4 Orbit Left Numpad 4 ^ + 4 Pan Left Numpad ^ + 4 6 Orbit Right Numpad 6 ^ + 6 Pan Right Numpad ^ + 6 8 Orbit Up Numpad 8 ^ + 8 Pan Up Numpad ^ + 8 2 Oribit Down Numpad 2 ^ + 2 Pan Down Numpad ^ + 2 - Zoom Out Numpad - Zoom In (seems not to work) (UI) Cursor \u00b6 The 3D cursor is a pivot point for various features. You can e.g. rotate objects around the cursor (see image below). Newly created objects get created at this position. You can also use the cursor to snap objects to it or the other way around. Key/Action Result right click set 3D cursor position \u21e7 + c reset 3D cursor to the centre of the scene \u21e7 + s open snap menu (snap to cursor and so on) (Modeling) Modes \u00b6 The \u201cObject Mode\u201d is for working with objects in a whole and editing your scene. You can add objects, cameras lamps and others in this mode. The \u201cEdit Mode\u201d is for editing the vertices, edges or faces of an object. When using modifiers you see their effect in object mode, not in Edit Mode . You can switch between Object and Edit mode just by hitting \u21e5 when your mouse is ove the 3D viewport. There are more modes available. Readmore in the docs. (Modeling) Add & Delete \u00b6 On the tool bar on the left of the 3D view you have various possibilities to add objects. Use the Create tab an the left to add basic shapes. You can also use the hotkey \u21e7 + a or use the \u201cAdd\u201d menu at the bottom of the 3D view. When you create a new shape you get a new panel at the bottom of the toolbar. it is called the operator panel. There you can set additional settings for the newly created shape e.g. the subdivision of a ICO Sphere or the depth and the radius of a cylinder ad so on. This is only possible on creation of the shape. If the operator panel does not show up just hit F6 to show it as a floating panel. To delete the selection hit x this applies for Edit- and Object Mode. In Edit Mode you get an additional panel to decide what should be deleted e.g. Vertices, edges, faces and even more options like edge collapse and more. You need to play with it and read in the manual about it. Key/Action Result Toolbar Left add different type of objects Add Menu add different type of objects \u21e7 + a open \u201cAdd\u201d floating panel F6 open \u201cOperator\u201d floating panel x delete selection (Modeling) Making Selections \u00b6 To select objects use the left mouse click (if set to left selection. The default is right selection). You can add or remove objects to or from the selection by holding \u21e7 . Selected objects are highlighted in orange (default theme). The first in the order of selected objects is a bit brighter. You can also select everything by hitting a . In \u201cEdit Mode\u201d there are some extra options for selecting things. You can switch between vertices, edges and faces selection and you can combine them with the buttons on the bar below the 3D view. Ther are also other selection modes. The rectangular (key r ) or circular (key c ) selection allows to select by clicking and dragging. This only applies to the visible objects, vertices, edges and faces. You can change this behavior if you want to selection to apply to non visible objects as well. There are even more options for selecting. Like Inverting selections and so on. See the Blender Manual Action Result Mode Left Mouse select Object/Edit Mode Left Mouse + \u21e7 add/remove Object/Edit Mode a select all Object/Edit Mode ^ + i invert the current selection Object/Edit Mode ^ + Tab selection mode switcher Edit Mode b + left mouse click & drag select rectangular area Edit Mode c + left mouse click & drag paint selection area Edit Mode c + left mouse + mouse wheel paint selection increase or decrease Edit Mode (Modeling) Duplication \u00b6 To duplicate the current selection (in edit or object mode) just hit \u21e7 + d . This also sets the newly created objects into grab mode so you can set their new position. All the Transformation rules apply. Action Result Mode \u21e7 + d duplicates the selected object Object/Edit Mode (Modeling) Transformation Using Manipulators \u00b6 You can transform objects, groups, vertices, edges and faces (i.e. your selection) by using the 3D manipulators. Change between grab, rotate and scale mode on the bottom of the 3D view. You can combine them or shut them off totally. If you click and drag into the circle at the centre of the manipulator you transform on all axis at once. (Modeling) Transformation Using Hotkeys \u00b6 Sometimes it is more convenient to use the hotkeys. When using the hotkeys you can easily constrain the manipulation to an axis. Just hit for example g + x to only move the selection on the global x-axis. If you hit x twice you transform on the objects local axis. The second transformation corresponds with the pull down next to the manipulator buttons on the button of the view. Key manipulation r rotate r + x/y/z rotate on one axis only (global) r + x/y/z \u00d7 2 rotate on one axis only (selected axis) g transform (grab) g + x/y/z transform (grab) on one axis only (global) g + x/y/z \u00d7 2 transform (grab) on one axis only (selected axis) s scale s + x/y/z scale on one axis only (global) s + x/y/z \u00d7 2 scale on one axis only (selected axis) alt + g snaps selection to the center of the scene (Object Mode only) (Modeling) Mesh Manipulation \u00b6 Besides just adding primitive shapes on one another you can also edit the mesh directly. To do this Go to Edit Mode by hitting the \u21e5 key (TAB). As mentioned in the (Modeling Making Selections) section you can select in different ways. Vertices only, faces or edges or combine these options. You can now move the selection around. To manipulate your mesh even further you can copy and paste your selection. ( \u2318 + c & \u2318 + v ). Additionally you can use several options on the toolbar to edit your mesh. Each option has its own operators. (Modeling) Extrude \u00b6 Extrudes the current selection. All Transformation and Selection options apply. You can basically differentiate between \u201cextrude region\u201d (hit e or use the button on the toolbar) and \u201cextrude individual\u201d. The region extrudes the selection together. The individual extrusion uses each local axis to extrude. See the manual for further information. Key/Action Result e Extrude Region \u2325 + e Extrude Individual (Modeling) Separate \u00b6 You might come to the point where you need to separate an object in multiple ones. There is an easy short cut for that. Go into Edit Mode (hit \u21e5) and select the faces or vertices you want in an new object and hit p . You will be presented with a dialog that allows you to split by: Key/Action Result p brings up the separate menu Split Type Outcome Selected This option separates the selection to a new object. All Loose Parts Separates the mesh in its unconnected parts. By Material Creates separate mesh objects for each material. (Modeling) Join \u00b6 To join selected objects into one single object you can select them all. in j . Be aware that they will all be joined into the last selected object. You can see it in the difference in the highlight color. Key/Action Result ^ + j merges all objects into the last selected Active object. (Modeling) Other Manipulations \u00b6 Key/Action Result Description f Fill Fills the selection with vertices, edges and faces ^ + f Face manipulation panel Various options to edit faces i inset face Works only with faces ^ + b bevel Works only with faces ^ + e Edge manipulation panel Various options to edit edges ^ + v Vertex manipulation panel Various options to edit vertices w Specials Panel Holds various options To create new geometry on an existing one you can use the several options. Subdivide, Loop Cut and Slide or the Knife to name just a few. Subdivide for example divides the surface a defined number of times and gives some more options, like smoothness and fractal noise. Loop Cut and Slide allows to subdivide a selection as well by setting a position to cut in by dragging the mouse. the Knife does what it says. Allows to cut the mesh. Hint You will see extra information on some tools on the bottom bar of the 3D view. The Knife for example needs to be confirmed by hitting \u21a9 (RETURN). Explore the tools by playing with them. Using Modifiers \u00b6 Some modifications can be tedious when done by hand. Fortunately lots of operations have already been pre defined as modifiers. You can access them on the \u201cProperties\u201d window under the little wrench. All modifiers first only affect the selected object. If you want to generate real mesh from them you need to apply them. Also be aware that modifiers work in stack. The order of them define their outcome. You can move them in the stack order by using the up and down arrows on each modifier. We will take a look at some of them that might be useful for our purpose. When you export your form for exchange with the forthcoming applications you don\u2019t need to apply these modifiers. An export to Wavefront obj will add all these vertices to the mesh. Read more about modifiers here. Type Name Short Description Generate Subdivision Surface Modifier Subdivide surface of selected object Generate Boolean Modifier Intersect, unify or differentiate objects from one another Deform Simple Deform Modifier Deform objects by Twisting, bending,tabering or stretching them Generate Array Modifier Create multiple copies of an object (Modifiers) Subdivision Surface \u00b6 This modifier divides each surface by the number set in the view/render section of it. The difference between view and render should be clear. View is what we see in the 3D view. Render is what will be used in the final render. For our purpose the only thing we need to be concerned about is the view setting. This is what will be exported into our exchange formats. You can also switch between a \u201cSimple\u201d and \u201cCatmull-Clark\u201d. To see the result before applying you need to switch the shading type to Wireframe. You can read more about this modifier here. \u201cCatmull-Clark\u201d The default option, subdivides and smooths the surfaces. According to its Wikipedia page , the \u201carbitrary-looking formula was chosen by Catmull and Clark based on the aesthetic appearance of the resulting surfaces rather than on a mathematical derivation. (Modifiers) Boolean \u00b6 The \u201cBoolean Modifier\u201d can be used to create intersection between two objects. When you first apply it you wont see any change. You need to select another object in your scene to be used as the mesh object for the operation. Then you have 3 different methods to apply the modifier. Read more here. Methods Result Intersect The target mesh is subtracted from the modified mesh. Union The target mesh is added to the modified mesh. Difference The modified mesh is subtracted from the target mesh. (Modifiers) Simple Deform \u00b6 The Simple Deform modifier allows easy application of a simple deformation to an object (meshes, lattices, curves, surfaces and texts are supported). Simple Deform Modifier Mode Description Twist Rotates around the Z axis. Bend Bends the mesh over the Z axis. Taper Linearly scales along Z axis. Stretch Stretches the object along the Z axis (negative Factor leads to squash), preserving volume by scaling inversely on the X and Y axes.. (Modifiers) Array \u00b6 The \u201cArray Modifier\u201d can be used to duplicate elements. You can offset the copies on the 3 axis relative or constantly. You can use an objects transformation to define the offset as well. There are some more options for this modifier. It can be pretty powerful to create multiple copies of an object. Read more here. (Modifiers) Subdivide and Displace \u00b6 To show you what can be done by combining several modifiers the following animation shows how to use the Subdivision Surface and Displace modifiers together. The subdivision is done to create more vertices and the displacement to generate some offset on them. The displace modifier uses textures to offset the vertices. You could also use an image or a ramp to displace the vertices. Be creative. This is already rather complex for the starters. Use it as inspiration. There are many more modifiers. To much to explore them all here. Play with some/all of them. Add-ons \u00b6 Additionally to the many build in features of Blender there is a whole ecosystem of Add-ons . There are several Add-ons that are directly distributed with Blender but bot enabled by default. You can browse them in the user preferences an enable those that you like to use. You can also install Add-ons from file. These are Python scripts that are written by members of the community. For our project there are two Add-ons we need to download and install. Export: Paper Model (.svg) | Export printable net for paper modeling Autodesk DXF (.dxf) | Export geometry to .DXF file format. (Add-on) Paper Model \u00b6 Both are pretty self-explanatory. The Paper Model Add-on adds under File > Export > Paper Model (.svg) the possibility to export a unfolded vector graphic of the selected object. In the export panel ae on the lower left side some export options for the graphic. You can specify the page size, add margins, create tabs for gluing your model and some more options but the default options are pretty good. If the export fails try to scale your model down or increase the size. We will adjust the plans size later on in a vector editor. Read some more about this Add-on here. (Add-on) DXF export \u00b6 Hint The DXF export Add-on might be useful when working with \u201cdxf2papercraft\u201d. Export \u00b6 To export our data we can use different options. For one we can use the Paper Model Add-on]. Then we have a vector graphic we just have to clean up and convert to DXF to use it for laser cutting. If this is your chosen workflow, move on to Creating Clean Plans . If you want to use Slicer or Paperkura you need to use an interchange format like STL or OBJ . You don\u2019t need to specify a final scaling. Slicer and Paperkura both allow to edit the scaling of the Model and the material/paper size. (Export) STL STereoLithography \u00b6 If you use STL you need to use the ascii format and apply all modifiers when used. It would be better that you don\u2019t apply the modifiers from within the Add-on. As already mentioned the modifiers depend on their stack, so applying them by hand gives you a better control over the outcome. (Export) OBJ Wavefront \u00b6 You can also use the Wavefront OBJ format. It has some more options for the export then the STL but creates a equivalent result. You also should apply the modifiers first as mentioned for the STL export.","title":"Blender"},{"location":"blender/#about-blender","text":"Blender is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games.

The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming through the instant gratification of visual feedback. The language builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel Shiffman, who formally joined as a third project lead. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Using Processing \u00b6 Note We wont go in depth into programming with Processing. This here are just an example on how to export usable 3D data for our purpose. As an example we have two simple 3D scene sketches that will create a .obj files you can use in Slicer or Paperkura. Before trying to create plans from the export you should take a look at the output in Blender. There might be some errors or problems with the sizes or centers of these models. To use these sketches you need to install the OBJExport library from Nervous System . There is a guide on the Processing Wiki on how to install libraries manually . If this worked you can open the Processing IDE, paste the sketches blow into the window and run them. The first sketch will create a simple scene with a cube and plane and will create the output.obj file next to your Processing sketch. The second sketch is a bit more complex. It creates several boxes and also does the output to a .obj file. These files can be imported and edited in Blender. /** * Simple sketch for doing papercraft * uses the OBJExport library from * http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/tools/obj/ * * @author Fabian \"fabiantheblind\" Mor\u00f3n Zirfas * @license ISC https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC */ import nervoussystem.obj.*; // import the lib /** * the setup runs once. * We only set the size of the canvas. * */ void setup() { size(500, 400, P3D); } /** * This runs all the time.

Don\u2019t perforate your plan . The marks for the folding lines are enough to. We will cut them with different settings leaving a visual mark where to fold your material. Object and Material Settings \u00b6 When you import your 3D model you first need to set some options. The manufacturing settings allow you to set the size of your material. This can be set to a fairly huge size (the laser cutter at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany) has a size of 1200 mm to 900 mm). You can set the \u201cObject Size\u201d when you need a defined size. Another way is adjusting the size based on your material size. if your desired object size exceeds you material size the application will allow you to export several cut sheets. What\u2019s more important is to set the \u201cThickness\u201d of your material. This will determine how narrow/wide the holes for tongues and tabs are we are going to produce later on. There is also another setting we need to take in account. The \u201cSlot Offset\u201d. This is the amount of material the laser will take away. For cutting grey cardboard around 0.5 to 1.5 mm you can set this to <=1 mm. You can set all of these settings by pressing the little wrench and then adjusting them on the bottom of the application window. You also can save some presets for your material. When you done with setting up your material choose from the Construction Techniques \u201cFolded Panels\u201d. Folded Panels \u00b6 Separates your 3D model into 2D segments of triangular meshes. These segments (panels) are folded multiple times, then attached using one of ten different joint types. Use paper, cardboard, even sheet metal. - From Slicer Help (within Application) (Folded Panels) Optimize Panels/Add Remove Seams \u00b6 If you still want to edit your model you can adjust the count of vertices in these panels or add new seams to your object. You can also split all panels for the final cut plan. (Folded Panels) Joint Types \u00b6 Here you can select how you want to connect your unfolded object after production. Same are useful for paper, others can be used for sewing or lacing. We are going to focus on the tab and tongue types. Joint Types Description (taken from Slicer Help) Diamond Connect panels by folding and affixing (gluing or welding) the triangular ticks. Change Tick Radius to set the width of the ticks. Gear Connect panels by folding and affixing (gluing or welding) the rectangular ticks. The dark areas of the image need to be cut out. Change Tooth Radius to set the distance from the edge of the sheet for the cutouts. Change Tick Spacing to set the spacing between the cutouts. Change Tooth Scale to set the height of the teeth. Laced Connect joints by lacing sheets together. Change Hole Radius to make the holes bigger. Change Joint Space to set the spacing between rivets used to connect the joints. Change Tick Radius to set the distance of the rivet holes from the edge of the sheet. Multitab Connect joint by fixing ticks together. Change Tick Radius to change the height of the ticks. Change Tab Fraction to change the width of the ticks (tabs). Puzzle Connect joint by fitting pieces together. Change Tick Radius to change the height of the ticks. Rivet Connect joint by riveting ticks to one another. Change Hole Radius to make the holes bigger. Change Joint Space to increase or decrease the number of rivets used to connect the joints. Change Tick Radius to set the distance of the rivet holes from the edge of the sheet. Seam Connect joints by sewing them together (like a sewing pattern). Change the Seam Radius to change the width of the seam\u2019s panel border. Tab Connect joints by inserting a tick into slots. Change the Tick Radius to change the width and length of the slots and ticks. Ticked Connect joints by connecting the ticks along the seams Change Tick Space to make the ticks closer to one another or further apart. Change the Seam Radius to change the width of the seam\u2019s panel border. Tongue Connect joint by inserting a tick into slots. Change Tick Radius to change the tick length and width and slot width. (Folded Panels) Joint Type Tab \u00b6 On the first image below you see the plan for a cube laid out with the \u201cTab\u201d joint type. The size of the cube is 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm on a sheet with the size of 700 mm \u00d7 1000 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm. The \u201cTab Joints\u201d are set to have a \u201cTick Radius\u201d of 10 mm (set it at the bottom of the window). The second one has the same settings but with \u201cSplit Panels\u201d enabled. (Folded Panels) Joint Type Tongue \u00b6 The \u201cTongue\u201d type is similar to the tab type. We used here the same settings. The size of the cube is 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm on a sheet with the size of 700 mm \u00d7 1000 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm.

Other Construction Techniques \u00b6 Note There are several other construction techniques you can use. We won\u2019t go into them for now. Stacked Slices Cross sections your 3D model, cutting it into slices you can glue and stack on top of one another. Use the Dowels option to make it easier to line up and assemble your model. You can recreate the model using any flat material you can cut. - From Slicer Help (within Application) Interlocked Slices Cuts your 3D model into two stacks of slotted slices. Lock them together in a grid, like when building a 3D puzzle. This uses less material than stacked slices. - From Slicer Help (within Application) Curve Cuts slices perpendicular to a curve, resembling ribs. Use this for organic shapes, such as for modelling a brontosaurus. Also, use the Navigation tools to help rotate your view to see the curve. - From Slicer Help (within Application) Radial Slices Cuts your 3D model into radiating slices from a central point. Use this for a round symmetrical object, such as a vase. - From Slicer Help (within Application) Slices 3D Cross sections your 3D model, similar to Stacked Slices. Rather than a stepped section for each slice, the section conforms to the surface of the 3D model. - From Slicer Help (within Application) Model Issues \u00b6 If the application detects an error with your plan you can see them on the right side in the \u201cModel Issues\u201d tab. (Export) Get 2D Plans \u00b6 On the images above you already can see the laid out plans. These can be accessed on the right side after you\u2019ve selected your construction technique. Just click on them to see them in a larger view. To export them for laser cutting you need to login into your Autodesk account. Then you can go to the \u201cGet Plans\u201d panel and hit the file icon. On the bottom of the window you will see some options for the export. I suggest using the EPS (encapsulated postscript) file format. Then you can export your plan for further cleaning.","title":"Slicer for Fusion 360"},{"location":"slicer/#about-slicer-for-fusion-360","text":"When you are done with creating a simple 3D object either by using Blender or with Processing you can move on to Autodesks Slicer for Fusion 360 .

Rather than a stepped section for each slice, the section conforms to the surface of the 3D model. - From Slicer Help (within Application)","title":"Other Construction Techniques"},{"location":"slicer/#model-issues","text":"If the application detects an error with your plan you can see them on the right side in the \u201cModel Issues\u201d tab.","title":"Model Issues"},{"location":"slicer/#export-get-2d-plans","text":"On the images above you already can see the laid out plans. These can be accessed on the right side after you\u2019ve selected your construction technique. Just click on them to see them in a larger view. To export them for laser cutting you need to login into your Autodesk account. Then you can go to the \u201cGet Plans\u201d panel and hit the file icon. On the bottom of the window you will see some options for the export. I suggest using the EPS (encapsulated postscript) file format. Then you can export your plan for further cleaning.","title":"(Export) Get 2D Plans"},{"location":"workflows/","text":"There are several different workflows to create data the laser can read. We will concentrate for now on using Blender with Autodesks Slicer. There are other applications that can produce similar results. Workflow Slicer \u00b6 This is the most straight forward way. There is no knowledge of programming needed and all the tools used are open source and free except for Adobe Illustrator what can be substituted with Inkscape. The learning curve for Blender can be a bit steep but there are tons of good tutorials out there. Take a look at the Links for some external references about it.

You will need some knowledge of programming. Also creating free forms is a bit tricky when you don\u2019t use a decent 3D library. We won\u2019t go into depth on this one. There are two sample sketches provided that show the usage of the OBJExport library to get some 3D data output but it only scratches the surface. Any contribution is welcome.
