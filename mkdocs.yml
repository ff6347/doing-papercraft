site_description: This document is a write-down for a workshop @ the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany) as part of the seminar "Datenobjekte" (data objects) by Professor Boris Müller (a.k.a @borism on Twitter). We will explore the minimal basics of the 3D application Blender to create primitive shapes which will then be unfolded for laser cutting.
